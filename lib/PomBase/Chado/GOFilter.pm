 Usage   : my $filter = PomBase::Chado::GOFilter->new(config => $config,
                                                      chado => $chado);
           $filter->process();
 Function: Remove redundant GO annotation by removing feature_cvterms where
           there is a more specific annotation or an annotation with a better
           evidence code.
 Args    : $chado - a schema object of the Chado database
 Return  : nothing, dies on error
